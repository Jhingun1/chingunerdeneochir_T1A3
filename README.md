# Description

Our goal is to create a Hangman game. This is a game in which the computer selects a random word and the player must guess it using letters suggested by the computer within a set number of guesses.
# Purpose

The aim of Hangman is to provide a fun way to learn new words and put your general knowledge to the test. This is accomplished by encouraging the user to guess the hidden word one letter at a time, which can be useful for remembering new word spelling.
# Functionality

- Start program
- Program greets the user.
- Program prompts user for input if they want to play
  - If user enters "No", program exits
  - If user enters "Yes, program continues
- Prompts user for username, if nothing entered defaults to "Player"
- Program randomly generates a word for user to guess
- Prompts the user for input of a letter
- Checks user input
  - If correct, displays letter in secret word
  - If incorrect, displays number of lives left
- User input will loop until:
  - All letters are matched in the secret word
    - If true, then will display the secret word and victory screen
  - There are 0 lives left
    - If true, then will display the secret word and game over screen
- Prompts user if they want to play again
  - If user enters "No", program exits
  - If user enters "Yes", program will return with new word for user to guess

7. Guess what the word is by entering one letter at a time.
8. Each correct letter will be revealed in the word.
